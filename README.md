# gossiping-bus-drivers
code challenge "gossiping bus drivers" 

See: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10kyCQbLNvRrBdr3nPr0AOQT80xJZwbxcoI_QgIE4aQ8/edit#heading=h.4mcr0mcs1zd3

classes busDriver, busStop and routeRunner have all logic to solve the challenge.
example scripts simply define the drivers and their routes to be executed.

to run:
ex: "python example1.py"


this is my first try with the Python language. The solution is not very elegant, but since it was my first try with Python, I focused on solving the problem in a "blunt" and direct approach.
It would be a good exercice if I tried to refactor this solution using an event driven approach.
